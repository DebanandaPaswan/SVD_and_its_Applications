# SVD_and_its_Applications
Singular Value Decomposition: Concept and its Applications.
Suppose A is a matrix. It can be decomposed into 3 parts.
    
    A(m x m) = U(m x m).S(m x n).Vt(n x n)
   
where, Vt = eigenvectors (orthogonal matrix)
        U = orthogonal matrix
        S = diagonal matrix
